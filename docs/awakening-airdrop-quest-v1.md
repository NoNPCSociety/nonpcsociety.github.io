# $NONPC Awakening Airdrop Quest  
## A 6-Month Liquidity-Preserving Incentive Architecture

**Project:** No NPC Society  
**Token:** $NONPC (Solana SPL)  
**Campaign Duration:** 6 Months  
**Structure:** 3 Seasons × 2 Months  

---

## 1. Executive Overview

The $NONPC Awakening Airdrop Quest is a six-month incentive experiment designed to expand community participation while preserving on-chain liquidity integrity.

Unlike conventional inflationary airdrop models, this campaign introduces a structurally bounded reward system tied to effective liquidity and long-term holder behavior.

The objective is not rapid distribution.  
The objective is structural durability.

---

## 2. Core Design Principles

### 2.1 Liquidity Preservation Rule

Monthly token rewards are capped at:

> **2% of Effective Liquidity**

Example (Reference Snapshot):
- Effective Liquidity: $24,000  
- Monthly Cap: $480 equivalent in $NONPC  
- Season Cap (2 months): $960  
- Safety Margin Applied: ~50%  

This rule ensures that even under worst-case full sell-off scenarios, structural market damage remains bounded.

---

### 2.2 95% Non-Token Incentive Structure

Daily and weekly rewards are distributed primarily as:

- Awakening Points (AP)
- OAT Badges
- Contributor Recognition
- NFT Participation Rights

Token conversion occurs only at Season conclusion.

This reduces short-term extraction pressure and discourages mercenary capital behavior.

---

### 2.3 Two-Tier Reward Pool

At the end of each Season:

**Open Pool (20%)**
- All Stage completers
- AP-proportional distribution

**Holder Pool (80%)**
- Full Stage completion
- Gateway qualification (Web3 Score L1 or Passport)
- Week 4 & Week 8 Holder Check completion
- Final claim confirmation

This structure shifts expected value toward retention rather than participation alone.

---

## 3. Campaign Architecture

### Season 1: Awakening (Month 1–2)

Objective:
- Expand participation base
- Convert participants into actual holders

Key Mechanisms:
- Low-friction Stage 1 entry tasks
- Gateway filtering (anti-Sybil)
- Holder Check (Week 4 & Week 8)
- AP-weighted reward calculation

---

### Season 2: Uprising (Month 3–4)

Objective:
- Encourage content production
- Reinforce long-term holding behavior

Additions:
- Meme creation
- Educational threads
- Translation initiatives
- Diamond Hands verification (50% retention check)

---

### Season 3: Sovereignty (Month 5–6)

Objective:
- Transition toward governance readiness

Additions:
- Governance simulation voting
- Proposal drafting
- Snapshot participation
- Longitudinal holding verification

---

## 4. Holder Check Mechanism

Holder eligibility is based on:

> $15 equivalent $NONPC minimum  
> Calculated using official Raydium 24h average price at Week 3 snapshot

Verification Window:
- 72-hour limited claim period  
- On-chain credential validation only  
- No manual overrides  

Missed claims remain eligible for Open Pool but not Holder Pool.

This maintains operational clarity and security integrity.

---

## 5. Reward Calculation Logic (Season Model)

1. Define Base Budget (2% liquidity rule)
2. Allocate:
   - 20% → Open Pool
   - 80% → Holder Pool
3. Apply AP-weighted proportional distribution
4. Apply 20% wallet cap (if ≥20 Holder wallets)
5. Reallocate excess proportionally
6. Execute bulk distribution on Solana

No vesting is applied in Season 1.
Future Seasons may adjust parameters.

---

## 6. Anti-Sybil & Automation Policy

The campaign strictly follows:

- Galxe native credential verification
- No manual approvals
- No post-period exceptions
- No screenshot-based claims
- No spreadsheet reconciliation

All decisions rely solely on automated on-chain or platform-based verification.

---

## 7. Liquidity Impact Containment

Under reference conditions:

- Full sell-off scenario impact: ~2–3%
- Actual impact dependent on market depth and timing

Reward budgets scale proportionally with liquidity growth.
Reward budgets contract if liquidity declines.

This dynamic elasticity prevents systemic stress.

---

## 8. Relationship to DAO Transition

The campaign mirrors the roadmap phases:

1. Infiltration
2. Awakening
3. Uprising
4. Escape

By Season 3 completion, governance participation behavior is expected to be structurally seeded.

This is not merely distribution.
It is governance conditioning.

---

## 9. Relationship to AFX (Awakening Flywheel Experiment)

The Awakening Airdrop Quest serves as the pre-AFX participation engine.

While AFX focuses on:

- POL compounding
- Fee-based internal energy
- Referral Graph reinforcement

The Quest prepares:

- Holder quality
- Behavioral filtering
- Governance literacy

Together, they form a liquidity-retentive growth architecture.

---

## 10. Risk Disclosure

This campaign does not guarantee:

- Token appreciation
- Liquidity expansion
- Market stability
- Governance efficiency

All crypto assets involve volatility and regulatory risk.

Participants are solely responsible for their decisions.

## 12. Final Position

The Awakening Airdrop Quest is not a distribution campaign.

It is a bounded liquidity experiment designed to test whether incentive alignment can be engineered without inflationary dependency.

Structure over hype.  
Durability over velocity.
