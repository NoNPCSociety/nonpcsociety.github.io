## 1. Abstract

No NPC Society ($NONPC) is a Solana-based decentralized movement designed to explore simulation theory, human awakening, and structurally sustainable token architecture.

Unlike traditional meme tokens that depend on short-term speculation cycles, $NONPC is engineered around structural durability, liquidity stability, and progressive DAO transition.

This document defines the architectural design, tokenomics framework, liquidity governance structure, and long-term decentralization roadmap.

The Awakening Flywheel Experiment (AFX) is introduced as an extension layer to this base architecture.

## 2. Design Philosophy

### 2.1 Structural Over Popularity

The protocol is designed to grow through structural reinforcement rather than viral amplification.

Primary principles:

- Minimize inflation-based incentives
- Avoid artificial APY mechanisms
- Prevent pump-and-dump cycles
- Preserve treasury transparency
- Enable verifiable governance transition

---

### 2.2 Transparency as a System Primitive

Transparency is treated as a structural requirement, not marketing language.

Mechanisms include:

- Public vault addresses
- Multisig treasury custody
- LP lock transparency
- Authority revocation where applicable
- Verifiable token supply

---

## 3. Tokenomics Architecture

### 3.1 Total Supply

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000 $NONPC  
Fixed supply model. No inflation schedule.

---

### 3.2 Allocation Structure

Allocation categories:

- Founder Allocation
- Development Fund
- Community Distribution
- Marketing Allocation
- DAO Treasury
- Presale Allocation
- Presale Unsold (Strategic Emission Reserve)

Each allocation is transparently custodied via Squads multisig across separated vaults.

---

### 3.3 Custody Structure (Multisig Governance)

Treasury is managed via Squads Multisig with three purpose-separated vaults:

Vault #1 – Long-Term Custody  
Founder / Dev / DAO / Presale Unsold (Strategic Emission Reserve)

Vault #2 – Operational Funds  
Community / Marketing

Vault #3 – LP Operations Reserve

All vault addresses are publicly verifiable on Solana explorers.

---

### 3.4 Supply Control Mechanism

$NONPC uses the standard Solana SPL Token Program.

No custom token contract is deployed.

Where applicable:
- Mint authority is revoked or restricted.
- Freeze authority is revoked where appropriate.
- No hidden mint functions exist.

This ensures immutability and eliminates discretionary inflation risk.

---

## 4. Liquidity Design

Liquidity is designed around structural persistence rather than yield farming.

Core components:

- Initial Liquidity Provision
- LP Lock Strategy (12-month rolling lock model)
- Rolling re-lock mechanism prior to unlock date
- Multisig governance over LP operational reserves

Liquidity is treated as protocol infrastructure, not speculative fuel.

---

## 5. Governance & DAO Transition

The project roadmap is structured into phased decentralization:

Phase 1 – Infiltration  
Phase 2 – Awakening  
Phase 3 – Uprising (DAO Activation)  
Phase 4 – Escape (Sustained Governance)

DAO transition occurs when:

- Liquidity stability threshold is met
- Treasury governance framework is fully operational
- On-chain participation metrics reach sustainable levels

Governance mechanisms will integrate Realms-compatible DAO frameworks.

---

## 6. Security Model

Security is enforced through:

- SPL Standard Token Program
- Multisig treasury execution
- Public vault transparency
- LP lock contract transparency
- No custom arbitrary contract logic

Operational scripts related to treasury execution are maintained privately for security reasons.

## 7. Awakening Flywheel Experiment (AFX) Relationship

The Awakening Flywheel Experiment (AFX) is a structural extension model designed to:

- Enable liquidity compounding
- Improve capital retention
- Replace inflationary reward logic
- Incentivize long-term participation

AFX operates as a protocol-level structural engine layered on top of the $NONPC base architecture.

## 8. Risk Considerations

Key risks include:

- Market volatility
- Liquidity contraction
- Regulatory shifts
- Adoption stagnation
- Infrastructure dependency (Solana network performance)

The protocol does not guarantee returns and does not promise financial profit.

Participation is voluntary and subject to market risk.
