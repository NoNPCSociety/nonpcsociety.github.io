## 2. Major Case Study: marumaruNFT ($MARU)

marumaruNFT was an independently launched token project designed and led by Koichi Hatta.

### 2.1 Market Performance Metrics

- Peak liquidity: approximately USD $6,000,000
- Maximum token price appreciation: approximately 500x from early-stage pricing
- Sustained upward price structure for approximately 12 months post-listing
- Maintained thick liquidity for over one year after launch
- Early and mid-stage participants were provided with substantial profit opportunities
- Successfully listed on a centralized exchange (CEX)

The project did not rely on hyper-inflationary rewards or artificial APY mechanisms.

## 3. Lifecycle Outcome

After approximately three years post-launch:

- Internal structural weaknesses emerged
- Product direction deteriorated
- Market interest declined
- The token was eventually delisted

While early and mid-stage participants benefited significantly, many later-stage participants unfortunately experienced losses.

## 4. Lessons from Market Cycles

Through marumaruNFT, Koichi Hatta experienced:

- Bull market acceleration dynamics
- Liquidity expansion phases
- Speculative overheating
- Structural decay patterns
- Attention collapse cycles
- Post-peak contraction

These experiences directly informed the architectural philosophy behind No NPC Society ($NONPC) and the Awakening Flywheel Experiment (AFX).

The design focus shifted toward:

- Structural sustainability
- Non-inflationary incentive logic
- Liquidity durability
- Governance transparency
- Risk containment

## 5. Current Focus: No NPC Society ($NONPC)

No NPC Society represents a second-generation structural design informed by prior market experience.

Core principles include:

- SPL standard token architecture
- No custom inflation contract
- Multisig treasury custody
- Rolling LP lock model
- Progressive DAO transition
- AFX-based structural liquidity compounding

## 6. Architectural Positioning

Koichi Hatta does not position himself as a speculative promoter.

He positions himself as:

- A structural designer of token economies
- A liquidity systems architect
- A practitioner who has experienced full-cycle market expansion and contraction
- A builder informed by empirical outcomes rather than theory alone

## 7. Origin Statement

marumaruNFT was architected and led by Koichi Hatta and reached:

- ~500x token price growth
- ~$6M peak liquidity
- Sustained upward structure for approximately one year
- CEX listing achievement

Following its eventual decline and delisting after approximately three years, its full lifecycle provided foundational lessons applied to $NONPC and AFX.

Koichi Hatta continues to design token systems focused on structural resilience rather than speculative hype.
