## 2. Major Case Study: marumaruNFT ($MARU)

marumaruNFT was an independently launched token project designed and led by Koichi Hatta.

### 2.1 Launch & Timeline

- Lifecycle duration: approximately 3 years
- Delisting and project closure: December 2025

---

### 2.2 Market Performance Metrics

- Peak liquidity: approximately USD $6,000,000
- Maximum token price appreciation: approximately 500x from early-stage pricing
- Sustained upward price trajectory for approximately 12 months post-launch
- Maintained thick liquidity for over one year
- Early and mid-stage participants were provided with substantial profit opportunities
- Successfully listed on a centralized exchange (CEX)

The project did not rely on hyper-inflationary reward structures or artificial APY mechanisms.

## 3. Lifecycle Outcome

After approximately three years:

- Internal structural weaknesses developed
- Product direction deteriorated
- Market attention declined
- The token was delisted in December 2025
- Project operations were formally concluded

While early and mid-stage participants benefited significantly, many participants who entered during later stages unfortunately experienced losses.

## 4. Lessons from Market Cycles

Through marumaruNFT (2022–2025), Koichi Hatta experienced and analyzed:

- Initial liquidity expansion dynamics
- Sustained bull-phase structural growth
- Market overheating conditions
- Internal structural degradation
- Declining attention cycles
- Terminal contraction phases

This full-cycle experience directly informed the architectural philosophy behind No NPC Society ($NONPC) and the Awakening Flywheel Experiment (AFX).

Design focus shifted toward:

- Structural sustainability over speculative velocity
- Non-inflationary incentive logic
- Liquidity durability mechanisms
- Governance transparency
- Explicit risk acknowledgment

## 5. Current Focus: No NPC Society ($NONPC)

No NPC Society represents a second-generation token architecture informed by empirical market-cycle experience.

Core principles include:

- SPL standard token architecture
- No custom inflation contract
- Multisig treasury custody
- Rolling LP lock model
- Progressive DAO transition
- AFX-based structural liquidity compounding

## 6. Architectural Positioning

Koichi Hatta positions himself as:

- A structural designer of token economies
- A liquidity systems architect
- A practitioner who has experienced full-cycle market expansion and contraction
- A builder informed by empirical outcomes rather than speculative theory

## 7. Origin Statement

marumaruNFT was launched in September 2022 on PancakeSwap and operated until December 2025.

It achieved:

- ~500x token price growth
- ~$6M peak liquidity
- Sustained upward structure for approximately one year
- CEX listing

Its eventual decline and delisting provided foundational structural lessons applied to the design of $NONPC and AFX.

Koichi Hatta continues to design token systems focused on structural resilience rather than short-term speculation.
